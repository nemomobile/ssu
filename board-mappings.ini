#
# This file is used by SSU to find out which device (or device variant) it's
# running on, and use this information to look for device family, and device
# specific adaptation(s). The last two values are used when resolving URLs,
# and therefore change depending on vendor setup.
#
# To avoid quoting in the search strings SSU will do each checks on the
# _value_, and return the key, if successful. The device model returned
# my either be the device model, or a variant. Before resolving the family
# and adaptations variants will be resolved through entries under the
# variants category.
#
# Valid categories for determining the model:
# - file.exists -- checks for existince of a file in the filesystem
# - systeminfo.equals -- compares the model returned by QSystemInfo
#                        with the value provided
# - cpuinfo.contains -- searches /proc/cpuinfo for a string
# - arch.equals -- compares with zyppers arch (like i586)
#
# Resolve order is:
#  file.exists -> systeminfo.equals -> cpuinfo.contains -> arch.equals
#
# The found model (after resolving variants) will be used as category. The
# following keys are valid there:
# - family -- the device family, used for the family specific adaptation
# - adaptation -- the adaptation for the specific category
#
# Both family and adaptation can also have flavour specifier, which allows to have
# different family and adaptation line for each of the flavours, e.g,
# - family-flavour -- where flavour can be devel, testing or release
# - adaptation-devel -- as above but for adaptation
#
# The value of adaptations gets converted into a QStringList, which uses
# commas as separator. If one of the adaptation names contains a comma it
# needs to be quoted:
#   adaptation=foo
#   adaptation="foo, bar", baz
#   adaptation=foo, bar, baz
#
# The N9x mappings should be solved through sysinfo, but that's currently
# broken on Mer/Nemo
